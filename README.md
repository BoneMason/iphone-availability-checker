# iphone-availability-checker
A node script to check iPhone 6s availability.

Checks for inventory at specified stores, and sends a [pushover](https://pushover.net/) notification when specific models are available.
Inspect or view source on [the reservation page](https://reserve.cdn-apple.com/US/en_US/reserve/iPhone/availability?returnURL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone%2Fiphone6s&channel=1&iPP=Y) to get the model and store numbers.

The code is quick and dirty, but it gets the job done.
